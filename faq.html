                    CTF stands for "Capture the Flag". CTFs are a type of
                    computer security competition. Certain pieces of
                    information, called "flags", are placed on servers,
                    encrypted, hidden, or otherwise stored somewhere difficult
                    to access. During the competition, different challenges are
                    released which allow the participants to reverse engineer,
                    break, hack, decrypt, and do whatever it takes to capture
                    that flag. When a team submits this flag to a scoring page,
                    they will get points for the submission. To learn more,

                    also, the second one from India organized independently by
                    any college. This is now the 4th Edition of the annually
                    organized vishwaCTF, and the first time that it is being
                    held globally.

                    able to learn various new concepts while enjoying the
                    competition, not being too overwhelmed with it. As such,

                    We love Computer Science and CTFs. Competing in CTFs is one
                    of our favorite things to do. Unfortunately, there aren't
                    many CTFs out there designed for beginners. We found that we
                    learned a lot about computer security very quickly by
                    particating in CTFs. vishwaCTF will teach participants about
                    other areas of computer science as well. vishwaCTF is meant
                    to follow up on the success of CTFs like picoCTF and HSCTF.

                    last 3 years allowing only local players to participate in
                    it. But, vishwaCTF'21 will be held entirely online on this
                    website starting 13th Mar at 3:30 PM for 36Hrs. Once the
                    competition starts, all users will be able to log in and

                    solved by only a few teams. All teams have the potential of

                    There will be several dozen challenges, each worth an
                    appropriate number of points based on its difficulty. The
                    points of a challenge are determined by the number of
                    participants able to solve that challenge. For example, a
                    challenge with 100 solves will have lower points than one
                    with just 10 solves. You may read more about the Dynamic

                    When you solve a problem, you send your answer (or 'key', or

                    to your team's score. At the end of the competition the
                    team(s) with the highest scores are the winners. Time will
                    be used as a tie-breaker.

                    Participants in the CTF must abide by a few common sense
                    rules that ensure the competition is fair. These rules are
                    copied from picoCTF's FAQ: Attacking the scoring server,
                    other teams, or machines not explicitly designated as
                    targets is cheating. This includes both breaking into such
                    machines and denying others access to them (for example, by
                    altering a key or ping-flooding). Sharing keys or providing
                    overly-revealing hints with other teams is cheating, as is
                    being directly assisted by personnel outside the team (using
                    tools from the internet is OK; asking people on the internet
                    to help you solve the problem is not). We encourage you to
                    solve problems in novel and creative ways using all
                    available resources, but we do require that you solve them
                    yourselves.
