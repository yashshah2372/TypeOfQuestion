                VishwaCTF is the Flagship event of CyberCell, VIIT. At its inception, it was the first CTF from Maharashtra, India. And also, the second one from India organized independently by any college. Now, we again aim for higher heights going global with the 3rd Edition of VishwaCTF.
                At the same time, we also want to develop the CyberSecurity scene in India. And thats why, we chose to run a beginner-friendly CTF in the form of VishwaCTF-Mini before the main VishwaCTF so that there is more space to learn.
